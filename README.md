Sleek file manager written in gtkmm 4<br><br>

## Why does this exist?
Primarily because i got tired of my current file manager freezing and crashing so often.<br>
But also because there aren't a lot of good GTK 4 file managers out there yet.<br>
This also makes for a good learning experience & Side project.<br><br>

## Why is it called frog?
Coming up with names for projects is rather hard.<br>
Frog came to mind when i was thinking of "File Organizer"<br><br>

## What does the icon represent?
